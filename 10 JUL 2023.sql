-- When executing the SELECT statement with an ORDER BY clause, MySQL always evaluates the ORDER BY clause after the FROM and SELECT clauses:

-- Suppose that each page has 10 rows; to display 122 customers, you have 13 pages. The last 13th page contains two rows only.
-- This query uses the LIMIT clause to get rows of page 1 which contains the first 10 customers sorted by the customer name:

select customernumber, customername from customers
order by customername
limit 10;

-- This query uses the LIMIT clause to get the rows of the second page that include rows 11 â€“ 20:
select customernumber, customername from customers order by customerName
limit 10, 10;


-- using LIMIT to get the nth highest or lowest value

-- To get the nth highest or lowest value, you use the following LIMIT clause:

-- SELECT select_list
-- FROM table_name
-- ORDER BY sort_expression
-- LIMIT n-1, 1;
-- Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
-- The clause LIMIT n-1, 1 returns 1 row starting at the row n.

-- the following finds the customer who has the second-highest credit:

select customername, creditlimit from customers
order by creditlimit desc
limit 1,1;

-- double check

order by creditlimit desc;
